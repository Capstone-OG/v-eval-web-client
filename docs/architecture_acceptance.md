# ARCHITECTURE ACCEPTANCE & SYSTEM COMPREHENSION REPORT - V-EVAL WEB CLIENT

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Purpose

The **V-Eval Web Client** (`v-eval-web-client`) serves as the primary Single Page Application (SPA) frontend interface for the V-Eval educational ecosystem. It delivers a personalized, adaptive learning experience tailored for the Vietnamese National High School Assessment (V-ACT 2026), empowering students, teachers, and academic directors through modern interactive visualizations, real-time AI guidance, and automated assessment diagnostics.

## 4. Key Functional Modules & Pedagogical Alignment

### 4.1. Flow 1: Diagnostic Assessment (IRT 2PL Model)
- Integrated via `DiagnosticTestModal.jsx`.
- Measures initial student ability across 3 core evaluation domains (Mathematics, Language Arts, Natural & Social Sciences).
- Employs 2-Parameter Logistic (IRT 2PL) probability scoring with guessing parameter `c = 0.25` and ability estimation `theta`.

### 4.2. Flow 2: Dynamic Learning Roadmap (Kahn Topo & FSM)
- Visualized in `HeroBanner.jsx` and `MilestoneCard.jsx`.
- Tracks progressive stage unlocking based on Finite State Machine criteria: Lecture Video completion (`>= 80%`) and Quiz mastery (`>= 60%`).

### 4.3. Flow 3: Adaptive Practice & Remediation (ZPD & BKT)
- Executed in `AdaptiveQuizModal.jsx`.
- Dynamically delivers question items targeted within the Zone of Proximal Development (`ZPD \in [0.60, 0.75]`).
- Updates student mastery probability `P(L_t)` using Bayesian Knowledge Tracing transitions.

### 4.4. Flow 4: AI Socratic Tutor Widget
- Embedded in `AISocraticTutorWidget.jsx`.
- Simulates step-by-step Socratic pedagogy, guiding learners with heuristic questions rather than giving immediate answers.

## 5. Verification & Acceptance Criteria

1. **Clean Production Build**: Executed `npm run build` with 0 syntax or bundle errors; production artifacts outputted to `dist/` within 3.87 seconds.
2. **Docker Multi-Stage Validation**: `docker compose config` passes with 0 syntax errors across the entire 6-service microservices constellation.
3. **Repository Sync Automation**: Standalone `Scripts/push.bat` and root `Scripts/` correctly recognize `V-Eval-Web_Client` as a first-class project service.
